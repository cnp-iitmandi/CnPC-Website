                      on Soft Computing and Machine Intelligence (ISCMI2015)'.
                      This conference was organized by the International Neural
                      Network Society (INNS) India regional chapter, during
                      November 23-24, 2015 at Hong Kong. The main objective of
                      ISCMI 2015 is to present the latest research and results
                      of scientists related to soft computing & machine
                      intelligence topics. The above mentioned paper received
                      the "INNS Best Paper Award" among all the papers accepted
                      in the conference. The paper addressed the issues in
                      classifying the varying length patterns of speech using
                      support vector machines (SVM). In this paper authors have
                      proposed a novel example-specific density based kernel.
                      Authors have showed improved performance for the tasks
                      such as speech emotion recognition and speaker
                      identification when the proposed kernel was used with
                      SVM-based classifier.

                      The Project-Junior is the name given to a new form of
                      augmented reality (AR) interface developed for the
                      computing devices by IIT Mandi students. The basic idea
                      behind the project was to provide user with better means
                      of interacting with the computers.The students' brainchild

                      IIT Mandi is one of the five IITs who are developing
                      applications for Aakash tablets. Other IITs being IIT
                      Bombay, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Guwahati and IIT
                      Kharagpur where AADLs (Aakash application development
                      labs) have been set up. A "Workshop on competent use of
                      Aakash tablet and on Android" was organized on May 5, 2013
                      to impart training to the students on the technology
                      employed to develop applications for Akash tablet. About
                      65 students from J. L. N. Engineering College Sundernagar,
                      Himachal Pradesh participated in this workshop.
